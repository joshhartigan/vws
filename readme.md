### vws

a windowing system for the browser.

this is an experimental project, designed as a challenge for me;
there are some rules I will follow during its creation:

* must be all my own JavaScript (no jQuery, Underscore, etc.)
* the `index.html` must remain the same as it begun as - just boilerplate with a
  `canvas` tag. (the only difference I may make is adding `script` tags)
* vws must follow a 80s, bad-retro look and feel
